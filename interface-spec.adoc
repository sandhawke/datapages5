_Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler_ -- http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/[Einstein]

Features (some not yet implemented):

* Very fast for small datasets (thousands of records)
* Data records are JSON-compatible JavaScript objects
* Objects can refer to each other naturally (like `alice.mother.mother.age`, cycles are okay)
* Instances can be linked into a federation (eg between web client and web server), with efficient propagation
* Easy to build live displays of dynamically-changing query results (no
polling)
* Supports transient records, aka event streaming
* Supports streaming attached media blobs, eg JPEGs
* Works with https://github.com/sandhawke/vocabspec[vocabspec] to handle
schema validation, migration (with views), and integration
* Supports temporal and provenance features (only show data resulting from sources users a and b before time t)
* Supports access control for use in multiuser backends


== Design Concepts

TBD

== Standard methods on a db (database view)

The 'ondurable' argument is always optional and is mostly useful for
UI operations, giving the user feedback that it's completed.  We could
use promises.   (Is that efficient when it's usually ignored?)

=== db.create(obj, ondurable)

If obj is not already in db, creates a new datapage


ISSUE: consider calling 'add', since sometimes that feels more right

On return, source-object is modified to have a unique-in-this-db
'__id' property which is required on subsequent calls to update and
delete, and can be used in filtering (for properties whose value is an
object).

done is called with the page once it's in persistent storage and has
been assigned a URL.  It's passed the page as currently known.  It's
fine to create lots of objects, update them, and even delete them,
before the first done(...)  is called.  Realistically, you could do a
million creates before done(...) is called.

=== db.update(current-page, overlay, done)

=== db.delete(page, done)

=== db.on / db.off / db.once

Request to have a function called when database state changes.
Details are below in the list of events.  Probably implemented with
EventEmitter3, but use of methods other than .on .off and .once is not
supported.

=== db.filter(expr)   aka    db.query(expr)   aka db.where(expr)

=== [PLANNED] db.count()

=== [PLANNED] db.sort(prop-or-prop-array) => returned dbview with ordering

If a db is ordered, then .limit makes a lot more sense.

Also db.first(), db.last(), db.index(0), db.index(-1)

=== [PLANNED] db.limit(n) => returns dbview with max n pages

Aka db.slice(0, n-1)

=== [IDEA] db.select(arrayOfPropertyNames)   aka db.project(...)

A performance hint, telling the underlying system that it's safe to
ignore all properties not in the given list.  That is, it returns a
dbview where no effort is made to report the values of properties not
in this list.  Could be read as "properties I care about".

If your on-appear listener only looks at three properties, then it's good to put a .select() for those three properties before the .on(), so no effort is made to transport and even compute the values for those properties.

The default is all defined properties, as per vocabspec.

Behavior is undefined if you update or create with properties not in
the select list.

Note that SELECT A WHERE B="FOO" has to be done like:

db.where({b: 'foo'}).select('a')

NOT db.select('a').where({b: 'foo'}) because .where can't even see b,
because it wasn't passed through by .select('a')

=== [IDEA] db.join(n)

Returns a read-only dbview containing n-tuples where each position has each element in db.

For example, if db contains {a:1} and {a:2}:

then db.join(2) is
       {1:{a:1}, 2:{a:1}}
       {1:{a:1}, 2:{a:2}}
       {1:{a:2}, 2:{a:1}}
       {1:{a:2}, 2:{a:2}}

db.join(3) is

       {1:{a:1}, 2:{a:1}, 3:{a:1}}
       {1:{a:1}, 2:{a:1}, 3:{a:2}}
       ...
       {1:{a:2}, 2:{a:2}, 3:{a:2}}

This allows relational database joins to be expressed within the
datapages formalism.  Actually traversing the results of a join is not
recommended and might not be supported (an n-way join of a datapage
with k pages will have k^n pages).  Instead, the join should be
followed immediately by a .where, which can implement a more efficient
search.

For example, in SQL given tables LIKES (person, food) and FOODFROM (food, origin), the query SELECT person, origin WHERE LIKES.food = FOODFROM.food would be

db.join(2)
  .where({'1.isLIKE': true,
          '2.isFOODFROM': true,
          '1.food': {$valueOfProperty: '2.food'}})
  .select(['1.person', '2.origin'])          

(Consider making it .joinWhere(n, filterexpr, renames) to avoid issues.)

This can probably be done more cleanly as a virtual page rule:

 db.addVirtualPageRule({likes: 'person, food',
                        foodfrom: 'food, origin'},
                       'person, origin',
                        (likes, foodfrom)


 db.addVirtualPageRule('person, likesFoodFrom', 'person, food', 'food, origin', 
                       (likes, foodfrom) => {
                          if (likes.food === foodfrom.food) {
                             return {person: likes.person,
                                     likesFoodFrom: foodfrom.origin}
                          }
                       }

It'd be nice to have better filter exprs, like `{ food: {$wanted: true}, origin: {$exists: true} }`

We could do forward chaining just running that blindly, but for
backward chaining we'd want a lot more.   Maybe

 db.$exists = {$exists: true} // etc
 db.addVirtualPageRule({person: db.$exists, likesFoodFrom: db.$exists},
                       [{person: db.$exists,
                         food: db.$exists},
                        {food: {$eq: {$valueOfProperty: '0.food'}},
                         ... 

OR just a simple statement of === join fields.  Other relations are
less useful for optimizing.

 db.join(['food', 'food']) ....   that doesn't quite work, I expect.

== Events

=== Event: appear

Emitted when a new page appears in the dbview, passed that page.

=== Event: disappear

Emitted when a page goes away from the dbview, passed that page.

(Maybe we want a cheaper version, disappearId, which is only passed
the id.  But it's not clear the id is the thing you care about.)

=== Event: stable

=== Event: progress

Emitted with (stepsDone, totalSteps), at least once per second during
long operations.  stepsDone will always increase (unless things are
restarted), but totalSteps might also, so the fraction complete
(stepsDone / totalSteps) might decrease.  'stable' occurs when
stepsDone === totalSteps.

=== Event: results

Emitted the same time as 'stable', but given an Array (or Array-like
object) containing a frozen copy of the current db.  Producing and/or
maintaining that copy might be expensive, so us 'stable' unless you're
actually going to use that parameter.

=== Event: updating

Properties of one of the pages in the db is about to change

Passed (old value, overlay), *before* the overlay has been applied.

Contrast with 'updated', this allows filtering based on what the old
value was without having to remember it.

=== Event: updated

Passed (new value, overlay), without any way to tell what the old value was

=== Event: changed

Emitted whenever stable or updated?  Somethat that's useful
arraydom.CleverDOMDriver, still to be exactly sorted.  Are those
functions passed 'results'?  Probably.

```js
[myFunc, {css}, db.where(...).sort(...)]
     myFunc(attrs, results)

[dbbind(myFunc, db.where(...).sort(...))]



 [cyan.view(myFunc, db...), {css}]
 cyan.view(myFunc, db...)
```

=== Event: error

Some asynchronous error has occured.  Passed an object with .message
and .code, where .code is listed under [Errors].

== Media Pages

Some datapages have an attached digital media instance, such as a jpeg
image or an mp3 audio sample.  This attachment is handled efficiently
as a "blob", not part of the datapage itself.

Every media page has a mediaType property, which has the normal IANA
media type information, like 'image/jpeg'.  (Encoding...?)

The media instance data itself can be accessed via a streaming API:

  db.mediaReadStrean(page, options) returns a readable stream

  db.mediaWriteStream(page, mediaType, options) returns a writable stream

When end() is called on the writable stream , the mediaType will be
set and db.mediaReadStream will work.

Concurrency during writes is not allowed: betwen the time
mediaWriteStream is called and the stream's end() function is called,
other calls to either of these functions will return null.  In theory
we should track the open read streams as well.  Also, in theory, we
could just pause the non-winning readers and writers, rather than
returning null.   Tricky.

(When there's an attached webserver, .mediaURL should also be set)


== Vocabulary

Every dbview has a .vocab which is a [vocabspec](https://github.com/sandhawke/vocabspec) instance.


== Instance Types

Various useful classes, nearly all of which implement approx the same
dbview interface, in roughly increasing order of complexity:

=== Inmem: basic in-memory store

Typically one creates a memstore and then relays behind it, rather
than re-implementing this interface.  Users can't tell the
difference as long as we have room to store all the pages in
memory.
 *
The callback parameter to create/update/delete is to be called back
if/when the data is "saved".  We don't do that, but hopefully some
watcher does, in which case it should invoke the callback (passing
it the page)


=== Filestore: on disk, each page is its own file
=== [PLANNED] ProxyClient(estream): appears as db, but all operations to an eventemitter

doesn't store anything, just relays everything to an
eventemitter.  We us ee.emit(event, obj) to send to the server and
ee.on/off/once(event, cb) to hear back.  Someone else can turn those
into postMessage or websockets or REST or whatever you want.

==== Companion to ProxyServer: an eventemitter which wraps a db


An eventemitter that provides access to a db, speaking the other end
of the protocol proxyclient uses.

given

```js
db2 = proxyclient(proxyserver(db1))
```

db2 and db1 should be indistinguishable.

Of course in practice you'll have some kind of transmission pipe
between them, or you wouldn't bother.


=== [PLANNED] Cache: wrapper which caches some/all of the underlying db

=== [PLANNED] Multisource: wrapper for 1-write N-read dbs, appearing as one db

Wraps a db, also implementing .attach(dbN) for including other
read-only dbs.  Queries query them as well and merge the results.

Writes just go back to primary db.

BUT, depending on our delta model, etc, writes might APPEAR to
change the data, by blocking data from other sources.  That part's
not quite there yet.

==== db.include()

=== [IDEA] Accesscontrolled: gives a partial view of a db based on 'user' attributes

** parameterized by uid and a trusted authinfo db

=== [IDEA] Sigma: wrapper which turns an append-only db of deltas into a normal db

Wraps an append-only db, where every page is "delta" (aka update, aka transaction) to produce a full db.

==== db.deltas links to underlying dbview with deltas

=== [IDEA] Appendfile: on disk store, only handles deltas

=== [IDEA] Rulebase: computes virtual properties, virtual pages, and checks validity
** with accessControled allows sophisticated rules
** probably needs a way to run safe JS functions

start with backchainsubproperty and forwardchainsubproperty
then bcdatalog and fcdatalog
then bcHorn, probably

=== [IDEA] EqualityReasoner


Gives a view of the data where some obj's are "about" the same
thing, and so the data from one carries over to the other.  For
example:

```js
db.add({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })
db.add({ name: "Alice", hairColor: "dark" })
db.addKey('name')
db.forEach(x => {
    // x = { name: 'Alice', age:30, hairColor: 'dark' }
})
```

uhhhhh.   Can't really be done with current API

Except, if N pages can be merged, the db creates a new page, and
db.mergedInto(p1, pmergerd)
db.mergedInto(p2, pmergerd)

BUT that would still show through p1 and p2

```js
db.filter({__smooshedIfPossible: true}).forEach( ... )

db.on('replace', ... )   or 'merge'N
...  p1 and p2 go away, and you get a new one?
```

THIS SEEMS OBSCURE, but actually, it's essential to making
decentralization work!


Do we need to change dbview?

? can you compare with ===

I think so, because of pointers / graphs

==== db.addKey (prop)

==== db.isSameSubjectAs (a, b)

==== db.makeSameSubjectAs (a, b)

==== db.isSamePageAs (a, b)

==== db.makeSameSubjectAs (a, b)

==== db.refmod(property, type)

Set the "reference mode" for given property to be given type, which is one of: page, subject, ...

Needs to be known for every property....    Do we default to 'subject' unless you say 'page'

=== [IDEA] vocabularyMapped view

basically run vocabspec convert on all data going in or out

easy to test inmem

might be used by rule engine to recognize its own vocabulary without
conflicting with anyone elses.
